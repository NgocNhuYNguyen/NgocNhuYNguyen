To do this, I will use a statistical modeling technique called LASSO regression, which not only builds a predictive model but also helps select the most important variables from the data.\nUltimately, the objective is to better understand how everyday choices and psychological well-being are linked to happiness, and to provide insights that could help individuals and professionals support mental health more effectively."

    "text": "Data Description\nThe dataset used in this project is titled “Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits (2019–2024)”, and it was created to explore the relationship between people’s lifestyle choices and their mental well-being. The data was collected from individuals around the world between 2019 and 2024 using online surveys and self-reported questionnaires.\nThe dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by Atharva Soundankar in 2025 and is publicly available for analysis. You can access it at the following link:\nSoundankar, Atharva. Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits (2019–2024). Kaggle, 2025\nThis dataset includes 12 variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nchr\nThe respondent’s country of residence\n\n\nAge\ndbl\nAge of the respondent (in years)\n\n\nGender\nchr\nGender identity of the respondent\n\n\nExercise Level\nchr\nFrequency or intensity of physical activity (e.g., low, moderate, high)\n\n\nDiet Type\nchr\nType of diet (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, balanced, keto, junk food)\n\n\nSleep Hours\ndbl\nAverage number of hours of sleep per day\n\n\nStress Level\nchr\nSelf-reported stress level (e.g., low, moderate, high)\n\n\nMental Health Condition\nchr\nAny diagnosed mental health condition (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD)\n\n\nWork Hours per Week\ndbl\nNumber of hours worked per week\n\n\nScreen Time per Day (Hours)\ndbl\nAverage number of hours spent looking at screens each day\n\n\nSocial Interaction Score\ndbl\nSelf-rated score of social connection or engagement on scale (1–10)\n\n\nHappiness Score\ndbl\nSelf-reported happiness score on scale (1–10)\n\n\n\nThese variables provide a mix of demographic, behavioral, and psychological information that allows us to investigate how different aspects of daily life and mental health may influence a person’s overall happiness.\n\nMental.Health.Lifestyle &lt;- read_csv(\"Mental_Health_Lifestyle_Dataset.csv\")\nhead(Mental.Health.Lifestyle)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  Country   Age Gender `Exercise Level` `Diet Type` `Sleep Hours` `Stress Level`\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 Brazil     48 Male   Low              Vegetarian            6.3 Low           \n2 Austra…    31 Male   Moderate         Vegan                 4.9 Low           \n3 Japan      37 Female Low              Vegetarian            7.2 High          \n4 Brazil     35 Male   Low              Vegan                 7.2 Low           \n5 Germany    46 Male   Low              Balanced              7.3 Low           \n6 Japan      23 Other  Moderate         Balanced              2.7 Moderate      \n# ℹ 5 more variables: `Mental Health Condition` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Work Hours per Week` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Screen Time per Day (Hours)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Social Interaction Score` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Happiness Score` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\nData Limitations\nAlthough the “Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits Dataset (2019–2024)” is useful for practicing data analysis and modeling, it has several problems that we should keep in mind:\nThe data is self-reported:\nAll the information in this dataset comes from people filling out surveys about themselves. This means there is no way to check if what they reported is accurate. People might overestimate healthy habits (like saying they exercise more than they do) or underestimate unhealthy ones (like not getting enough sleep). They might also give answers they think are more socially acceptable instead of being completely honest. This can make the data less reliable.\nSome variables are unclear or inconsistent:\nSome of the questions in the dataset are vague or not measured well. For example:\n“Stress Level” is said to be on a 1–10 scale, but the data uses categories like “Low,” “Moderate,” and “High,” which doesn’t match.\n“Exercise Level” is just labeled as “Low,” “Moderate,” or “High,” but it doesn’t tell us how often or how intensely people exercise.\nThe “Mental Health Condition” column includes things like depression and anxiety, but it doesn’t explain how severe they are or how they were diagnosed. These conditions are very complex, and simple labels might not show the full picture.\nSome data is missing or unclear:\nFor example, the “Gender” column includes a large number of people marked as “Other,” but it’s not clear what that means—whether they’re non-binary, chose not to say, or something else. Without more detail, it’s hard to use this information meaningfully.\nThe results might not apply to everyone:\nThe dataset was collected between 2019 and 2024, a period that included the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on people’s daily lives and mental health. Because of this, the results might not reflect what’s normal in other years. Also, we don’t know where the participants are from or how they were selected, so the dataset might not represent people from different countries, cultures, or income levels. That means any patterns we find might not apply to everyone.\nBecause of these issues, we should treat this dataset more like a practice dataset—similar to examples used in class—rather than something that gives real-world, trustworthy results. It’s still helpful for learning how to explore data and build models, but the results should not be taken as scientifically accurate."

    "text": "Data Wrangling (Optional Section)\nThe dataset I imported is already in a tidy format, meaning each row represents one observation and each column represents a variable. Therefore, no structural reshaping of the data was required.\nHowever, to build and evaluate a predictive model effectively, it is essential to split the data into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set (80% of the data) will be used to build the model and identify relationships between predictor variables—such as lifestyle habits and demographic characteristics—and the response variable, which is the Happiness Score. The test set (20% of the data) is held out and used to assess how well the model performs on new, unseen data.\nThis kind of split is important because it prevents overfitting and helps evaluate how well the model will generalize in real-world applications. The 80/20 ratio is a standard practice that strikes a balance between having enough data to train the model and reserving enough to test it meaningfully.

Since I have not yet conducted feature selection (e.g., via LASSO), I do not know which predictors are statistically most important. However, based on intuition and prior research, I initially suspect that screen time per day and sleep hours could play a meaningful role in predicting happiness.\nThis section explores three key variables:\n\nHappiness Score (the response variable)\nScreen Time per Day (Hours) (a potentially important predictor)\nSleep Hours (a potentially important predictor)\n\nThe following analysis examines the distributions of these variables, checks for unusual or problematic values, and begins to explore their relationships to guide future modeling.\n\n1.

The distribution appears fairly spread out and roughly uniform across the scale, meaning that respondents reported happiness levels that are quite evenly distributed from low to high. This uniformity is somewhat unusual for a subjective well-being measure, which often shows skewed or clustered patterns in real-world data. The absence of extreme outliers is also notable. Overall, this pattern raises questions about how the happiness scores were generated or categorized—whether the respondents truly felt evenly distributed levels of happiness, or if the data collection process or scale used may have led to artificial uniformity.\n\n\n2.

The data seems evenly spread out across this range, with no extreme values. However, this even distribution is unusual and may suggest that the data was collected in a way that limited the variety of screen time reported. For example, the data might have been grouped into specific time ranges (like 2 to 3 hours, 4 to 5 hours, etc.), which could explain why there are no values below 2 hours or above 8 hours. Normally, we’d expect more variation in screen time, so this pattern might point to how the data was recorded or categorized.\n\n\n3. Sleep Hours\nCheck for unusual values\n\n# since one day has 24 hours and the number of hours cannot be negative \nunusual_sleep &lt;- MHL_train |&gt; filter(\n  `Sleep Hours`&lt; 0 | `Sleep Hours` &gt; 24)\nunusual_sleep\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 12\n# ℹ 12 variables: Country &lt;chr&gt;, Age &lt;dbl&gt;, Gender &lt;chr&gt;, Exercise Level &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   Diet Type &lt;chr&gt;, Sleep Hours &lt;dbl&gt;, Stress Level &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   Mental Health Condition &lt;chr&gt;, Work Hours per Week &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Screen Time per Day (Hours) &lt;dbl&gt;, Social Interaction Score &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Happiness Score &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThen, there is no invalid sleep durations — all values fall within a realistic 0–24 hour range.\nSummary statistics\n\nMHL_train |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    num_total = n(),\n    num_missing = sum(is.na(`Sleep Hours`)),\n    min = min(`Sleep Hours`),\n    Q1 = quantile(`Sleep Hours`, 0.25),\n    median = median(`Sleep Hours`),\n    Q3 = quantile(`Sleep Hours`, 0.75),\n    max = max(`Sleep Hours`),\n    mean = mean(`Sleep Hours`),\n    sd = sd(`Sleep Hours`),\n    IQR = IQR(`Sleep Hours`)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  num_total num_missing   min    Q1 median    Q3   max  mean    sd   IQR\n      &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      2400           0   1.4   5.5    6.5   7.5  11.3  6.49  1.49     2\n\n\nVisualization\n\nggplot(data = MHL_train, \n        mapping = aes(\n          x = `Sleep Hours`\n          )\n        ) + \ngeom_histogram(center = 6, binwidth = 0.4) +\nlabs(title = \"Histogram of Sleep Hours\", x = \"Sleep Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Sleep hours range from about 1.4 to 11.3 hours, with an average of approximately 6.5 hours. Most people sleep between 5.5 and 7.5 hours, which centers around the recommended 7–8 hours of sleep per night. The distribution has a bell-shaped curve, which is typical for sleep data. There are no extreme outliers, and the spread seems reasonable. This suggests that the sleep data is likely realistic and reflects a natural variation in how long people sleep.\n\n\n4. Relationship between Lifestyle and Happiness\na) Screen Time vs Happiness\n\nggplot(data = MHL_train,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = `Screen Time per Day (Hours)`,\n         y = `Happiness Score`\n         )\n       ) +\ngeom_point(size = 0.8) +\nlabs(title = \"Screen Time per Day (Hours) vs. Happiness Score\",\nx = \"Screen Time per Day (Hours)\",\ny = \"Happiness Score\") +\ngeom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot Interpretation:\nThe scatterplot shows that happiness scores are fairly spread out across all levels of screen time. There is no clear upward or downward trend, although the smoothed line suggests a slight dip in happiness at moderate screen time levels, followed by a small increase. Overall, no strong pattern emerges.\nCorrelation Analysis:\n\ncor(MHL_train$`Happiness Score`, MHL_train$`Screen Time per Day (Hours)`)\n\n[1] 0.04427989\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient is approximately 0.044, indicating a very weak positive linear relationship between screen time and happiness. This supports the visual observation that screen time, at least on its own, does not have a meaningful impact on happiness in this dataset.\nConclusion:\nThere appears to be no significant relationship between screen time and happiness score. People with both low and high screen time report a wide range of happiness scores, and the slight trends in the data are not strong enough to suggest a real pattern. That means, screen time might still play a role when combined with other factors like sleep or stress. To get a better understanding of what influences happiness, it will be helpful to look at other lifestyle habits such as Sleep Hours.\nb) Sleep Hours vs Happiness\n\nggplot(data = MHL_train,\n       mapping = aes(\n         x = `Sleep Hours`,\n         y = `Happiness Score`\n         )\n       ) +\ngeom_point(size = 0.8) +\nlabs(title = \"Sleep Hours vs. Happiness Score\",\nx = \"Sleep Hours\",\ny = \"Happiness Score\") +\ngeom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot Interpretation:\nThe scatter plot shows only a very weak and non-linear relationship between sleep hours and happiness scores. Most participants reported sleeping between 5.5 and 7.5 hours, and their happiness scores generally fall between 4 and 7. The trend line suggests that people who sleep extremely little or a lot aren’t necessarily less happy, but they also aren’t much happier either.\nCorrelation Analysis:\n\ncor(MHL_train$`Happiness Score`, MHL_train$`Sleep Hours`)\n\n[1] 0.00852507\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient is 0.0085, which is extremely close to zero. This confirms that there’s essentially no linear relationship between sleep and happiness in this dataset.\nConclusion:\nThe effect of sleep hours on happiness score is very small. This suggests that sleep alone likely doesn’t play a major role in determining happiness — though it could interact with other factors like stress, screen time, or social interaction.\nThe exploratory analysis suggests that neither screen time nor sleep hours individually show a strong relationship with happiness score. To better understand what drives happiness, we now turn to modeling, where we will consider multiple lifestyle variables together. By using statistical and machine learning techniques, such as LASSO regression, we can identify which predictors are most influential and how they interact to impact happiness."

LASSO adds a penalty to the regression loss function, shrinking less important coefficients to zero, which simplifies the model and reduces overfitting. I used 10-fold cross-validation on the training data and tuned the penalty parameter over 200 values using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the performance metric.\nAfter fitting the LASSO model, 8 predictors were selected with non-zero coefficients. However, when fitting a standard linear regression model to evaluate statistical significance, only 3 variables — Social Interaction Score (−0.061), Screen Time per Day (Hours) (0.057), and Exercise Level (Low) (−0.057) — had 95% confidence intervals that did not include zero, suggesting a more reliable relationship with happiness.\nThe RMSE of the final LASSO model on the test set was 2.60, indicating moderate predictive accuracy on a scale where happiness scores range from 1 to 10."
